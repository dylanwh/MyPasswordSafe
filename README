Quick Instructions
===================
Please read doc/manual.html for all the information you'll probably need. If
for some reason you can't read html, you need Qt 3 <http://www.trolltech.com/>
to use MyPasswordSafe. Once that's setup, running "make" will compile everything
and "make install" will install everything to '/usr/local'. If you want it
installed someplace else try "PREFIX=$somepath make" and
"PREFIX=$somepath make install"

To compile quicker try "make -jN" where N is a number greater than 1.
