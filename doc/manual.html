	<h1><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h1>
	<p>
		MyPasswordSafe is a straight-forward, easy-to-use password manager that
		maintains compatibility with <a href="http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/">Password Safe</a> files. MyPasswordSafe
		has the following features:
		<ul>
			<li>Safes are encrypted when they are stored to disk.</li>
			<li>Passwords never have to be seen, because they are copied to
			the clipboard</li>
			<li>Random passwords can be generated.</li>
			<li>Window size, position, and column widths are remembered.</li>
			<li>Passwords remain encrypted until they need to be decrypted at
			the dialog and file levels.</li>
			<li>A safe can be made active so it will always be opened when
			MyPasswordSafe starts.</li>
			<li>Supports <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> in the safes</li>
			<li>Languages supported: English and French</li>
		</ul>

	<h1><a name="install">Installing</a></h1>
	<p>If you're reading this then you're either warm or hot. MyPasswordSafe
	comes in two distributions: a binary distribution and the source distribution.
	MyPasswordSafe requires <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/download/index.html">Qt 3</a> and <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>, so
	make sure you have those. Boost is only required to compile MyPasswordSafe, but Qt needs to be installed to run the binaries.
	<h2><a name="frombin">...From Binaries</a></h2>
	<p>The binary distribution is precompiled. It can be downloaded from MyPasswordSafe's
	<a href="http://www.semanticgap.com/myps/release/">download page</a>. Once that's downloaded, just untar it:
	</p>
	<pre>tar xvfz MyPasswordSafe-bin.tgz</pre>
	<p>That should create a directory with the MyPasswordSafe binary, this file,
	and some other documentation. Running "make install" inside the MyPasswordSafe directory will install everything under <i>/usr/local</i>. It should work in other locations, but the language files won't be found if they're not in <i>/usr/local/share/MyPasswordSafe/locale</i>. That should be all assuming it works. If it didn't
	keep reading.
	<h2><a name="fromsrc">...From Source</a></h2>
	<p>So you want to compile it for yourself. Make sure Qt 3 is installed, and download <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>. Boost doesn't need to be compiled, just untarred.<a href="http://www.semanticgap.com/myps/release/">Download the sources</a> and then untar MyPasswordSafe:
	<pre>tar xvfz MyPasswordSafe.src.tgz</pre>
	<p>You can untar Boost into MyPasswordSafe's directory. The project file (MyPasswordSafe.pro) expects "boost-1.30.2" to be in the directory. If it's not, a simple link made from your boost directory will work. You can change the project file by hand if your boost path is different. The Makefile also contains a PREFIX variable which sets the location where MyPasswordSafe will install it and its associated files. Change it if <i>/usr/local</i> isn't where you want it to install itself. Finally you can run make:
	</p>
<pre>cd MyPasswordSafe
make
make install</pre>
	<p>Now if that was successful you can start using MyPasswordSafe. If not, send me an email describing your situation. If for any reason you want to uninstall MyPasswordSafe, the Makefile has an uninstall directive. Running "make uninstall" will remove the files it installed.
	</p>
	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	<h1><a name="usage">Usage</a></h1>
	<p>
		MyPasswordSafe is straight-forward to use. Nearly all of the
		commands can be accessed from the menu, toolbar, context menu, or by
		keyboard. Before we delve into actual usage, let's cover how
		MyPasswordSafe can be started.
	</p>
	<h2><a name="starting">Starting MyPasswordSafe</a></h2>
	<p>Starting MyPasswordSafe is just like any other program, you just need to
		run it. If you copied the binary into your PATH, all you need to is type
		<i>MyPasswordSafe</i>. Otherwise you need to either change to the directory
		where the binary is or include that in the command line. Adding an icon
		to your favorite launcher may also be desired.
	</p>
	<p>When MyPasswordSafe starts for the first time, an empty safe
		is created. As you'll learn later, MyPasswordSafe has a thing
		called the active safe. The active safe gets opened when
		MyPasswordSafe starts saving you from having to always find
		it over and over.
	</p>
	<h2><a name="mainwindow">The Main Window</a></h2>
	<p>The main window isn't to complex. There's a list box, tool-bar, and menu.
	The tool-bar and menu duplicate each other quite a bit. Most of the action
	happens in the list box.
	</p>
	<center><img src="sshots/mainwindow.jpg"
	alt="Screenshot of MyPasswordSafe's main window"/></center>
	<p>The list box contains the passwords from the current safe.
	Double clicking on a password in the list box fetches the password for
	that item, and right clicking convienently pops up the edit menu next to
	the pointer. So what do those commands do?
	</p>
	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	<h2><a name="passwords">Managing Passwords</a></h2>
	<p>
		The edit menu contains the commands used to manage passwords. Each
		command's name is descriptive of what it does. For example,
		<i>Add Password</i> really does add a new password.
		<i>Delete Password</i> deletes the password selected password.
		And <i>Edit Password</i> opens up a dialog to edit the selected
		password.
	</p>
	<p>
		The last two commands may need some explanation. They are
		<i>Fetch User</i> and <i>Fetch Password</i>. Both copy
		information to the clipboard. One copies the user, and
		the other copies the password field.
	</p>
	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	<h2><a name="editpword">Edit Password Dialog</a></h2>
	<center><img src="sshots/editdialog.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the
	edit password dialog"/></center>
	<p>
		Both <i>Add Password</i> and <i>Edit Password</i> make use
		of the same dialog to edit a password's data. Passwords
		have four fields of information: name, user, password, and
		notes. All but the password field is displayed in the main
		window. The dialog also has three buttons that affect
		the password field.
		<ul>
			<li>Show: turns off the password masking making the
			password visible</li>
			<li>Fetch: copies the password to the clipboard</li>
			<li>Generate: fills in the password field with a
			random password</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	<h2><a name="safes">Opening and saving safes</a></h2>
	<p>Safes can be created, opened, and saved from the file menu. The
	commands work like any other application except when a pass-phrase
	is needed. MyPasswordSafe does support multiple file formats.
	Currently MyPasswordSafe only two file formats are supported, Password
	Safe safes and text files.
	</p>
	<p>Password Safe is a similiar to MyPasswordSafe, but runs only
		on Windows. Files created by Password Safe can be opened by
		MyPasswordSafe and vice-versa. The files are encrypted using
		the Blowfish algorithm, and are presumed to be secure. Use
		<i>dat</i> for the extension.
	</p>
	<p>Text files should <b><font color="red">NEVER</font></b>
	be used. All information is stored unencrypted. If you find
	them useful, go ahead and use them.
	</p>
	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	<h2><a name="prefs">Preferences</a></h2>
	<center><img src="sshots/prefsdialog.jpg"
	alt="Screenshot of the Preferences Dialog"/></center>
	<p>MyPasswordSafe isn't the most configurable, but it does
	have some options.
		<ul>
			<li>Active safe: this is the safe that MyPasswordSafe
			opens when it starts up; this can also be set using
			the <i>Make Active</i> item in the File menu</li>
			<li>Default user name: this is the username used for
			new passwords</li>
			<li>Clear clipboard on exit?: if this is checked,
			the clipboard is cleared when MyPasswordSafe closes</li>
			<li>Generated password length: sets the length of
			the passwords generated by pressing the Generate
			button in the Edit Password dialog</li>
			<li>Number of guesses: this is the number of times
			MyPasswordSafe will attempt to get the correct pass-phrase
			from you before it gives up.</li>
		</ul></p>
		<p>MyPasswordSafe also stores the position and size of the window
		as well as the column widths. These are set by changing them,
		and are not available in the Preferences dialog.
	</p>
	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	<h1><a name="faq">FAQ</a></h1>
		<h2>How secure is MyPasswordSafe?</h2>
		<p>It beats me. The safes should be secure unless the Blowfish
		algorithm gets cracked. It's when the program is running
		that I'm unsure of the security. I'm sure some pesky
		program could find your passwords in memory.
		</p>
		<p>If you know anything about how to make this program bullet
		proof, send me an email or a patch.
		</p>
		<h2>Where is the Windows version?</h2>
		<p>I really wish there was a Windows version, but I can't
		afford a Qt license. If you need a password manager for
		Windows, get <a href="http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/">Password
		Safe</a>. Versions &lt; 2 create files that MyPasswordSafe can load
		and save. [ Note to developers: if you have Qt for Windows,
		could you compile and package it for me? ]</p>
